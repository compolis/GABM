# JOSS Submission Planning and Draft

This document is dedicated to the planning, drafting, and tracking of the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) article for the GABM project.

## Purpose
- Centralize all information, requirements, and drafts related to the JOSS submission.
- Track progress, checklist, and collaborative input for the article.

## JOSS Submission Checklist
- [ ] Confirm all JOSS requirements (license, documentation, research use case, tests, etc.)
- [ ] Draft article (motivation, functionality, impact, references)
- [ ] Invite co-authors and confirm contributions
- [ ] Review and revise draft collaboratively
- [ ] Prepare repository for submission (public, GitHub Pages, etc.)
- [ ] Submit to JOSS and track review process

## Draft Structure
- Title
- Authors and affiliations
- Summary
- Statement of need
- Description

- Andy's musings:
    - GABM itself is designed to enable "conversations" between agents using LLMs, enriching prompt responses with context without retraining. This mirrors the collaborative process of working with a LLM pair-programmer (e.g. GitHub Copilot), where context and history inform responses and decisions. Viktoria and Ajay's vision for GABM aligns with this.
    - Andy worked with [Stan Openshaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Openshaw) in the late 1990s pioneering the use of AI and Fuzzy Inference in Geography by developing and using artificial neural network and fuzzy inference technologies to develop a prototype Synoptic Prediction System (SPS) for climate change mitigation and forecasting.
	- GABM can be something quite generic. For this project we want to get it to work for political debate and influence - particularly climate related, but it can be more general framework.
    - With Open Source, it is good to "release early and release often". To make research FAIR the mantra and our University values align with being "as open as possible, as closed as necessary".
      - Andy first heard this mantra/term at Knowledge Exchange event in Paris where he met [Jon Tennant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Tennant) who was advocating for "Open Science". There are different levels of openness. Journals like JOSS help break down these barriers.
