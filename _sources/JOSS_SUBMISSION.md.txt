## Drafts and Notes
- GABM is designed to enable "conversations" between agents using LLMs, enriching prompt responses with context without retraining. This mirrors the collaborative process of working with a LLM pair-programmer (e.g. GitHub Copilot), where context and history inform responses and decisions.
