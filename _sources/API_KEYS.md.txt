## API Key Setup

You need a `data/api_key.csv` file with your API keys. This file is not included in the repository for security reasons.

> **Security Warning:** Never commit your API keys or other secrets to the repository. The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude `data/api_key.csv` and other sensitive files from version control. Always keep your keys private and secure.

Ask the project maintainer for a template or example, or create it yourself with the following format (CSV with header):

```
api,key
openai,sk-...
deepseek,sk-...
genai,YOUR_GOOGLE_KEY
```

Place this file in the `data/` directory.

### Quick Setup

To quickly initialize your environment, test your API keys, and generate model lists and caches for all supported LLMs, use the provided setup utility:

```
make setup-llms
```

This will:
- Check for all required API keys (OpenAI, GenAI, DeepSeek)
- Test each key with a default prompt and model
- Generate initial `models.json` and `models.txt` for each LLM
- Initialize response caches (`cache.pkl`)
- Report any issues or missing keys
