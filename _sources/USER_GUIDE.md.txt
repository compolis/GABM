## Managing Logs and Caches
GABM creates logs and caches (such as prompt/response caches for LLM services) that can grow large over time. These files are not stored in the GitHub repository. Tools for tidying up logs and caches are planned for a future release. More details will be provided as these features are implemented.
## Key Documentation Files for Users
The following Markdown files are most relevant for users:

- **README.md**: Project overview and quick start instructions.
- **USER_GUIDE.md**: Detailed user instructions for installing, configuring, and running GABM.
- **SETUP_GUIDE_USER.md**: Step-by-step environment setup for users.
- **API_KEYS.md**: Information on required API keys for LLMs and how to configure them.

Refer to these files for guidance on using GABM. Additional documentation is available for developers and contributors.
