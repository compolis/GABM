- ABM simulation now runs by default: agents are grouped as Negative, Positive, and Neutral, and communicate to mix opinions over several rounds.
- Added matplotlib boxplot output to visualize opinion change over time (saved to data/output/test.png).
- Group sizes and simulation parameters are now easily configurable in the main script.
- Random seed set for reproducibility.
- Updated USER_GUIDE.md: added a new section "What Happens When You Run GABM?" and updated the Table of Contents to reflect the new ABM simulation behavior and outputs.
- Migrated LLM integration from deprecated `google-generativeai` to the new `google-genai` API, updating authentication and model listing logic.
- Extended and improved the test suite to cover all LLM service classes (OpenAI, GenAI, DeepSeek, PublicAI, and local LLMs), ensuring robust and maintainable LLM integration.
