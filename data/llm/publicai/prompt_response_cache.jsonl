It's what keeps you on the ground and what makes things fall when you drop them. Think of gravity like a big invisible magnet that attracts objects to each other. The bigger the object, the stronger its gravitational pull. For example, Earth is much bigger than you, so it pulls you towards it, which is why you stay on the ground. The same goes for planets, stars, and even galaxies - they all pull each other with gravity. \\n\\nHowever, it's important to note that gravity isn't just about big objects. It works on all objects, no matter how small. It's just that the effect is much less noticeable for small objects because they have much less mass. \\n\\nGravity is also what keeps planets in orbit around the Sun, and what keeps moons in orbit around planets. \\n\\nGravity was first explained by Sir Isaac Newton in his laws of motion, and later Albert Einstein's theory of General Relativity gave us a more detailed understanding of how gravity works, especially for very massive objects or objects moving at high speeds. \\n\\nSo in simple terms, gravity is a force that pulls everything towards everything else. It's what keeps the universe together!\", 'role': 'assistant'}}], 'usage': {'completion_tokens': 251, 'prompt_tokens': 72, 'total_tokens': 323}}"}
