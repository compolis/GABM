This is wanted and some results produced before the JOSS article is submitted. So this first draft is to focus on the platforming which is largely complete and the onboarding which has begun."},

To start the development of this repository I first looked at some preliminary work done by Ajay and Charlie where they had been figuring out how to communicate with LLMs using Python. With Viktoria and Ajay in our project kick-off meeting we had decided to try to develop the GABM technology mostly with Python. This was because Ajay was familiar with Python and he was aware that the LLM communication was being facilitated with Python libraries. None of us were aware of any Agent Based Model (ABM) frameworks in Python that we could use, but developing an ABM in Python is striaght forwards and Andy had experience of teaching this using Python and had developed some learning resources for this, aimed at Geographers, which are available online (https://agdturner.github.io/Python0/public_html/home/index.html)."},

In last two consultancy projects I have worked on in the last two years I have used Visual Studio Code and GitHub Copilot to accelerate developments. The suggestion to use this technology was made by a colleague Research Softwre Engineer, Nick Rhodes, who is a member of Sorrel and my team. Those earlier projects, MXG and RiboCode were TypeScript based. MXG was the first, the project involved developing a new Web based User Interface for creating and processing the XML format input and output files used in MESMER software. Details of MXG development are captured in the git history in the repository available at https://github.com/MESMER-kinetics/mxg the latest version of the tool is served out by GitHub page at https://mesmer-kinetics.github.io/mxg/.

RiboCode is an ongoing project that orchestrates a UI based on two styled [Mol*](https://github.com/molstar/molstar) viewers and is specifically geared for comparing two ribosome datasets in 3D. Like MXG, details are available openly via a GitHub repository, the repository for the RiboCode project developement also called Ribocode is: https://github.com/ribocode-slola/ribocode1/. Like MXG Ribocode is deployed as a [Progressive Web App (PWA)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) via GitHub Pages in a way that can be easily duplicated. Here is a link to the deployment: https://github.com/ribocode-slola/ribocode1/. It is worth mentioning these developments as Andy has been gaining experience in using the combination of Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot integration for some considerable time and brought this experience along with more experience of developing software and programs using Integrated Development Environments (IDE) to this project. Developers not using an AI copilot now are like developers not using an IDE ten years ago. Whilst good developers can cope as they know their ways well, they are specialists in using tools that are not so easy for newcomers to pick up and use. This is one of the great things about having an AI pair programmer that can shortcut development by the human developer asking the pair programmer how to do things without having to spend a long time reading documentation. We harness the power of machine reading and writing which is far superior to humans much more limited capability in this respect."},

    {"timestamp": "2026-02-09T09:02:00", "role": "user", "content": "Good work. Let's consider the importance of refelection and introspection. In UK e-Science training from 2005 to 2011 Andy learned about these things along with other enhanced methods for accelerating and catalysing research. At the time he was working in the social science domain on e-Social Science as part of the UK National Centre for e-Social Science. The community was based on the idea of sharing tools. knoweldge and computational resources to achieve more together. Some of Andy's social science colleagues based at the Oxford Internet Institute were reflecting on and trying to understand how more open provcesses change the research process itself. We were encouraged to follow and establish more open protocols and lay bare the process of our discoveries and developments so that they could better study and understand the process. Whilst this is important, it is also good to be refined and focus things, but in scientific research, we don't typical want magic a rabit out of a hat per se, we want to explain the trick. This does not spoil the trick as the anaolgy breaks down and really there is no entertainment value really in the sense of awe that others may get from knowing how a result was produced. Reproducability, automation and catalysing change are key to research and probably the survival of our civilization although we could be our own worse enemy unless we do mitigate the unbalances our information revolution is causing. People are both scared and in awe of AI. Although we must procede with caution and consider our effects on the system we are a product of, as with any new and powerful technology the important thing is to apply it to do good and not bad and part of this is to reflect. We don't have to build in checks and balances, but in terms of our current political systems, the way people vote and how they are influenced offers a route to  where power and command of resources that may be used nefariously. So, in waht we do, we should procede with caution. Others may use the technology we develop to their own ends, and indeed the technology and media companies that have influence are already being used to sway the outcome of elections."},

    {"timestamp": "2026-02-09T09:03:00", "role": "user", "content": "This refelction is somewhat important in terms of the application of a software license. A software license is a legal document that has three key things. It explains what users can do with the software, including how they may redistibute and build upon it, and it protects the developers in terms of limitng their liabilities. Together we chose the 3-clause BSD license for the software. We can change this and license the software in other ways, but changing this becaomes more difficult after the software is released and as more people from other organisations collaborate in development."},

    {"timestamp": "2026-02-09T09:05:00", "role": "user", "content": "Thank you. The last development changes were to provide a means to release GABM on PyPI. This was greatly simplified by GitHub Copilot that explained the process and the files required to Andy who was season at doing this sort of thing with Java code using Maven to release to Maven Central. We did this on Friday when we also created a delete release target in the Makefile so as to delete tagged releases on GitHub. Now, I don't know how easy it is to delete a release on PyPI, but it is very difficult to delete a release on Maven Central. This means that others can rely on it being there in perpetuity. This can reduce the overall burdon of storage and netowrk as developers can tend to rely on third party users picking up depenencies from these places using caches that reduce network burdon rather than having to distribute them with their programs to users in ways that are most likely less optimal for network traffic."},

Very recently we targetted and developed different documentation for users and developers and for getting set up and more in-depth guides. Deatils about the needed API keys for LLMs were abstracted into a separate Markdown file. For simplicity and also for reproducibility requirements-dev.txt and requirements.txt files were used to be clear about the dependencies. More flexibility of versions was provided for developer dependencies, but user requirements were pinned down.

Here is a draft email to Viktoria and Ajay:\n---\nSubject: JOSS Paper and Changing the Repository Settings from Private\n\nDear Viktoria and Ajay,\n\nI wanted to update you on our progress with the JOSS paper draft and discuss the next steps regarding the repository settings. The paper is coming together well, and we are aligning the documentation and development history to meet JOSS requirements.\n\nAs part of the submission process, the repository will need to be made public. I’d like to discuss your preferences and the timing for changing the repository settings from private to public, so we can proceed smoothly with the JOSS submission.\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts or if you have any concerns.\n\nBest regards,  \nAndy\n---\nLet me know if you’d like to revise or expand this draft before sending."},

As the GABM project has matured, I believe it would be a strong candidate for publication in the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS). Submitting to JOSS would help us document the project, increase its visibility, and provide a citable reference for our work.\n\nTo meet JOSS requirements, the repository will need to be made public. I’d like to discuss your thoughts on this, and the timing for changing the repository settings from private to public, so we can proceed smoothly if you agree with the submission plan.\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts or any concerns. I’m happy to provide more details about the JOSS process and what it would involve.\n\nBest regards,  \nAndy\n---\nLet me know if you’d like to adjust or expand this draft."},
