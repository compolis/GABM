It is a bit of a misnomer as in one view Science is open and publishing findings is what makes it so, but there are different levels of open and there are barriers in publishing. Something journals like JOSS help to break down. At the Paris meeting we considered other natural languages. As I understood it, the French don't have an issue with considering non-traditional 'sciences' as part of 'research'. So their terms embrace arts and humanities. This is a bit of a digression, but the point is that research software is developed in all disciplines and what we have achieved together and the way this is set up is relevent across all disciplines. So, the application we are focussing on - and it is key to have an application for JOSS submissions is in political science and the generative agent based models that Ajay is focussing on developing will be specifically geared to understanding political debate and influencing on climate change and mitigation debates."},

    {"timestamp": "2026-02-08T08:29:00", "role": "user", "content": "Another interesting reflection is that GABM itself is going to involve 'conversations' between agents using LLMs. The way this was envisaged by Viktoria and Ajay is about adding context to enrich the prompt responses from the LLM without it re-training. I imagine that this is how we are working together too. At times I have asked you to look back at the conversation history and I think you use this to figure out how best to respond. My friend and mentor Stan Openshaw would be most impressed by this. Stan outlived Jon, but tragedy struck in his midlife within a couple of years of us starting to work together. I initialise Stan's Wikipedia article many moons ago. It is here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Openshaw. It is worth mentioning Stan as he was an AI pioneer inovating the use of AI in Geography. In the late 1990's we worked together using articial neural network technology and fuzzy sets to develop a prototype Synoptic Prediction System (SPS). That system was about climate change mitigation and forecasting."},

Summary & Narrative:\n- Create a file like DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md or PROJECT_JOURNAL.md in your repo for the chronological summary and reflective narrative. This is useful for JOSS, contributors, and archival purposes.\n\n2. Session Logs:\n- Save compressed logs (e.g., .gz or .zip) of session interactions in a dedicated folder, such as logs/dev_sessions/. If logs are large, use GitHub LFS for storage and link them in your summary file.\n\n3. JOSS Submission:\n- Reference DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md and the logs in your JOSS paper, providing context and transparency.\n\nThis keeps your project organized, accessible, and compliant with open science best practices.
