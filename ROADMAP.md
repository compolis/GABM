# Project Roadmap

This file outlines planned next steps and future goals for the project. The repository is currently private; the first public release will be version 1.0.0.


## Planned for Version 0.2.0

- Implement tidy-up scripts for logs and caches to help users and developers manage storage and maintain a clean environment.


## Next Target: v0.2.0

- Begin development of an agent-based model (ABM) with agent personas derived from processed survey data.
- Implement 10 initialized agents, each with unique biases and opinions.
- Agents will use LLM API prompts and responses to have a "conversation" and modify their opinions based on their biases and what they "learn" or are influenced by in the conversation.
- Each agent will chat with every other agent twice.
- After the conversations, generate a graph showing individual and aggregate opinions and confidence levels.
- The graph will visualize both individual agent trajectories and overall group opinion/confidence.


## Future Milestone: v1.0.0 (First Public Release)

- Criteria and features for 1.0.0 to be determined...
